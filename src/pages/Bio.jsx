          London based <strong>Fall of Saturn</strong> proudly flying the flag of a new wave of
          groove metal. Conceived on an overcast Sunday afternoon in the Summer of 2019 by
          <strong> Val (drums)</strong> and <strong>Will (Bass)</strong> with the idea to start a
          new groove metal music venture. So the Rhythm section is sorted, next step find the right
          musicians to fill the missing pieces. In the Autumn <strong>guitarist Linas</strong>{' '}
          joined the project. After a short while the band decided to relocated our base from
          Earlsfield to West Ham in early 2020. Due unforeseen circumstances the final piece of the
          jigsaw didn’t fall into place until earlier 2022. Have to say it was worth the wait,{' '}
          <strong>Ernesto</strong> a man with a wide
          <strong> vocal </strong>
          ability who brings a nice range and depth to the music we have created. As a band we play
          in an extreme low tuning and we needed to find a balance between the new and old elements
          of metal.
