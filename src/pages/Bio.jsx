          London based <strong>Fall of Saturn</strong> proudly flying the flag of a new wave of
          groove metal. Playing in an extreme low tuning to create a nice balance between the new
          and old elements of metal. Our first song was released on Bandcamp late last year. Check
          it if you havenâ€™t already. The next single <strong>Knowledge is Power</strong> will be
          released on the <strong>19th of May</strong>
          with an accompanying video. further releases shortly will follow, showcasing the bands
          diversity and experience not to be pigeonholed into one genre or style. Keep{' '}
          <strong>Fall of Saturn</strong> in your sights as we are here to stay.
