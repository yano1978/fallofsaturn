              Fall of Saturn was conceived on an overcast Sunday afternoon in the summer of 2019 by
              Val (drums) and Will (bass), who shared a vision of creating a new groove metal
              project. With the rhythm section established, the next step was finding the right
              musicians to complete the lineup. In autumn 2019, guitarist Linas joined the project.
              The band relocated from Earlsfield to West Ham in early 2020. Due to unforeseen
              circumstances, the final piece of the puzzle didn't fall into place until early 2022
              with the addition of Ernesto, a vocalist with impressive range and depth who perfectly
              complements the music. As a band that plays in extremely low tuning, F.O.S has
              successfully balanced new and traditional elements of metal.

              The official birth of Fall of Saturn came with the release of our first single
              "MathemEthic" on Bandcamp in late 2022 (also available on Spotify). Earlier that same
              year, we made our live debut, bringing our sound to the stage. Our second single,
              "Knowledge is Power", was released on May 26, 2023, accompanied by a lyric video on
              YouTube. In late 2023, we entered the Metal to the Masses competition, advancing to
              the semifinals. During this period, we released our long-awaited debut album, "Spiral
              Decay" featuring previously released singles plus the crowd-pleasing, energy-surging
              "Nemesis" The album also showcases "Teotzin" revealing a slightly less intense side of
              the band with its foot-tapping groove, sleek guitar solo, and matching vocals. "R.I.P.
              (Rise in Popularity)"" has become the finale to most of our live shows, taking
              listeners on a journey with its abstract heavy groove and thought-provoking lyrics.

              In mid-2024, F.O.S became an active member of the London Metal Coalition (LMC).
              Looking ahead to 2025, the band's evolution continues with our upcoming single, "Pray
              or Prey", which will be accompanied by a video release. This new track will bridge our
              previous releases with our new experimental and modern style. So turn up the volume
              and come join us for the ride...
